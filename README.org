Personal Emacs configuration using Emacs 29 defaults and modern packages. My
older config was build around 2017-2018 using spacemacs, you can find that in
the ~spacemacs~ branch.

** Themes
The light theme, ~doom-rogue-light~, is based on my website's [[https://lepisma.xyz/][theme]] and [[https://lepisma.xyz/2017/10/28/ricing-org-mode/index.html][rice]] from
years back. It's high on use of old style serif faces and low on saturation.

/Dark theme is a work in progress./

These themes are built on [[https://github.com/doomemacs/themes][doom-themes]] framework and can also be used
independently. To recreate the looks above completely you would need other
assistive elisp in this config.

Additionally, the following fonts are needed for this set up:
1. [[https://github.com/lepisma/iosevka-lepisma][Iosevka-lepisma]]
2. Merriweather
3. EtBembo
4. Source Sans Pro

After install, also run ~(all-the-icons-install-fonts)~ and
~(nerd-icons-install-fonts)~.
